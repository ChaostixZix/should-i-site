# Should‑I Website Positioning Adjustments

**Version:** v1.1 — Consultant Context Added

This document contains **surgical, low‑risk copy additions and tweaks** designed to strengthen Should‑I’s positioning under three lenses:
- Sceptical investors
- Regulators / governance‑minded reviewers
- Enterprise buyers making defensible decisions

These changes **do not alter the core structure, tone, or philosophy** of the site. They make implicit strengths explicit.

## 1. Hero Section (Minor Sub‑line Adjustment)

**Current**
> Decision intelligence for small businesses  
> — before you commit capital, time, or people.

**Recommended**
> Decision intelligence for small businesses  
> — before you commit capital, time, or people **based on assumptions**.

**Why**
- Introduces the idea of *decision risk* immediately
- Frames Should‑I as an assumption‑testing system
- Signals seriousness without alarmism

---

## 2. “Why this isn’t just AI” (Single‑Sentence Addition)

**Add directly after the opening paragraph:**

> General AI tools are optimised to be helpful — not accountable. When the decision matters, that distinction matters.

**Why**
- Names the AI trust problem calmly
- Aligns with emerging governance and enterprise concerns
- Reinforces AI as an interpreter, not an authority

No other copy in this section needs to change.

## 3. Consultant Context (Value Anchor)

**Placement (important):** Immediately under the line **“This is a decision document, not a dashboard.”**

**Insert the following copy exactly as written:**

> For most small businesses, this level of analysis is typically delivered through consultants — often costing $10,000–$15,000 and taking weeks to produce.  
>  
> Should‑I exists to make those **core decision inputs** accessible, faster, and proportionate to the size of the decision.

**Why this placement works**
- Reads as context, not sales copy
- Anchors value only after credibility is established
- Passes consultant, legal, and investor scrutiny
- Makes pricing feel rational without mentioning price

## 4. Decision Integrity Block (New Micro‑Section)

**Placement:** Immediately after *“How Should‑I works”* or directly beneath *“This is a decision document, not a dashboard.”*

### Decision Integrity
Every Should‑I report is designed to stand up to scrutiny.

Each decision memo includes:
- Clear assumptions used in the analysis
- Evidence sources and data provenance
- Deterministic scoring where applicable
- Identified risk boundaries and constraints
- Conditions under which the conclusion would change

This ensures decisions are not just informed — they are explainable, auditable, and defensible.

**Why**
- Converts the product from “insight” to “decision infrastructure”
- Gives enterprise and regulated buyers political and procedural cover
- Clarifies the moat without technical language

---

## 5. CTA Qualification (Optional but Recommended)

**Current**
> Validate My Idea  
> Assess My Business

**Add below buttons (small text):**
> Used when the decision is real — not hypothetical.

**Why**
- Filters unserious users
- Attracts higher‑quality leads
- Reinforces that this is for high‑stakes moments

---

## 6. What Not to Change (Important)

Do **not**:
- Reference AGI, Anthropic, geopolitics, or timelines
- Add fear‑based or speculative language
- Introduce new sections or longer explanations
- Reposition as “AI governance” or “AI safety”

The strength of Should‑I is restraint.

---

## Strategic Outcome

With these changes, Should‑I shifts from:

> “A thoughtful decision‑intelligence product”

to:

> “A governed decision‑making layer built for accountability in an AI‑heavy world.”

The tone remains calm. The signal becomes unmistakable.

**Status:** Ready for immediate implementation
