          <p>Most business tools are built to reassure, not to inform.</p>
          <p>
            They surface activity instead of understanding. They reward optimism
            over realism. They turn uncertainty into charts, as if visibility
            alone reduces risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should-I exists because important decisions deserve more than
            surface confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            It exists to help people pause before committing capital, time, or
            people — and understand the conditions they're operating within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not to tell them what to do. Not to guarantee outcomes. But to
            reduce avoidable uncertainty.

          Why it's built this way
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--text-muted)]">
          <p>We didn't build Should-I to be fast, flashy, or comprehensive.</p>
          <p>We built it to be useful at the moment a decision is being made.</p>
          <p>That meant designing for:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Interpretation over raw data</li>
            <li>Context over metrics</li>
            <li>Constraints over upside stories</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most tools optimise for ongoing engagement. Should-I optimises for
            clarity at decision time.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why it starts with structured analysis, not dashboards. And
            why the intelligence compounds over time instead of resetting with
            each question.

        <div class="space-y-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--text-muted)]">
          <p>The lens behind Should-I is an analyst's lens.</p>
          <p>That means:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Asking what would need to be true for a decision to work</li>
            <li>Looking for fragility, not just opportunity</li>
            <li>Treating assumptions as things to test, not defend</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Good analysis doesn't promise success. It explains conditions.</p>
          <p>And conditions matter more than confidence.</p>

          Why we don't sell certainty
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--text-muted)]">
          <p>Certainty is a story people sell after outcomes are known.</p>
          <p>
            Before a decision, certainty is usually manufactured — by ignoring
            edge cases, compressing risk, or presenting averages as guarantees.
          </p>
          <p>We don't do that.</p>
          <p>Should-I is designed to surface:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Where outcomes are sensitive</li>
            <li>Where tolerance for error is low</li>
            <li>Where "reasonable" decisions quietly fail</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If a decision still makes sense after that, it's stronger for it.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="border-t border-[#E5E7EB] py-[120px]">
        <h2 class="text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-medium text-[var(--text)] mb-4">
          Our view on dashboards and data theatre
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--text-muted)]">
          <p>Dashboards are not intelligence.</p>
          <p>
            They show what is happening, not what it means. They encourage
            monitoring instead of thinking. They create the illusion of control
            without reducing risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's why Should-I produces written, decision-ready analysis — and
            uses AI to reason within that context — instead of adding another
            screen full of metrics.
          </p>
          <p>If you want more charts, there are better tools for that.</p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[var(--text-muted)]">
          <p>Should-I is designed for people who:</p>

            <li>Make decisions carefully</li>
            <li>Understand that risk can't be eliminated</li>

            <li>People looking for guarantees</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants a simple "yes" or "no"</li>
            <li>Businesses that prefer reassurance over realism</li>
